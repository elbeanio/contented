Title: Contented
Date: 2014-04-13

This is the sample site and probably some of the documentation for Contented.

Like a lot of people out there I have a lot of words - notes, writing, articles etc. stored on my hard drive waiting for something to be done with them. Contented is an attempt to give those files a platform, so that instead of languishing on my computer I can easily share those ideas without having to copy and paste, without having to use a browser-based editor, and without using a static site generator.
